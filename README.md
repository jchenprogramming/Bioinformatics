# DiffSeqAnalysis

DSA is an assistive bioinformatics tool designed for RNA differential gene expression analyses here at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. With the help of HTSeq/NOISeq/topGO, the program utilizes data from RNA sequencing (SAM), single nucleotide polymorphisms (VCF), and gene features (GTF) to compare expression patterns between crossed species.
